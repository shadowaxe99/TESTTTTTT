Shared Dependencies:

1. **Data Schemas**: All files will share a common data schema for the drop shipping data, which includes fields like product listings, customer orders, and supplier information. This schema will be used to structure the data for analysis.

2. **Exported Variables**: The machine learning models and NLU techniques will generate outputs that will be used across multiple files. For example, the output of the machine learning model in "machine_learning_models.py" will be used in "decision_making_item_selection.py" for item selection.

3. **Function Names**: Functions for data preprocessing, NLU, machine learning, decision making, data integration, and UI integration will be used across multiple files. These functions will be named according to their functionality, like preprocess_data(), understand_language(), train_model(), make_decision(), integrate_data(), and integrate_UI().

4. **Message Names**: Messages for user interaction in the UI, such as instructions for item selection and updates on the AI agent's actions, will be used in "user_interface_integration.py" and "deployment.py". These messages will be named according to their purpose, like instruction_message and update_message.

5. **DOM Element IDs**: The UI will have various DOM elements that JavaScript functions will interact with. These elements will have IDs like "itemSelectionInput" for user input on item selection, "actionMonitor" for monitoring the AI agent's actions, and "updateDisplay" for displaying updates.

6. **APIs**: APIs for data collection and real-time data integration will be used in "data_collection_preprocessing.py" and "real_time_data_integration.py". These APIs will be named according to the data they provide, like product_listing_API, customer_order_API, and supplier_info_API.

7. **Web Scraping Techniques**: Web scraping techniques will be used in "data_collection_preprocessing.py" and "real_time_data_integration.py" for collecting data from various sources. These techniques will be named according to the data they scrape, like scrape_product_listings(), scrape_customer_orders(), and scrape_supplier_info().
